Realizing that they might make a very good Pond Representative, G. Wiz recently confronted this democratic _raison d'etre_. In a fiercely fought campaign against several other reptile representative candidates, G. Wiz awaits the election results from a fancy new computerized system which promises extremely fast results.

    "* Follow steps carefully. Laboratory sessions often get a bit more complicated than their preceeding course sessions. Especially for early sessions which expose you to platforms with which you may not be familiar, take notes on commands you run and their corresponding effects/outputs. If you find yourself stuck on a step, let a TL or the professor know! Laboratory sessions do not mean that we won't guide you in the same way we do during other sessions.\n",
    "* Regularly ask and answer questions. Some of you may have more experience with the topics we're discussing than others. We can use this knowledge to our advantage. Let students try things for a while before offering help (always offer first). To ask questions, use your group's Slack channel or TL channels.\n",
    "* Store and transfer files using GitHub. Various forms of file storage are more or less volatile. You are responsible for backing up and storing files. If you're unsure of files which have been changed, you can always type git status in the terminal for your working folder to determine what you need to back up.\n",
    "* Keep all of your files. See above, but also remember that you're responsible for the files you create.\n",
    "* Back up your files regularly. See above (and above-above).\n",
    "* Review the Honor Code regularly when working. If you're taking a solution from another student or the Internet at-large (especially Stack Overflow), bear in mind that using these solutions can constitute a form of plagiarism that violates the Allegheny Honor Code. While it may seem easy and convenient to use these sources, it is equally easy and convenient to rely on them and create bad habits which include not attributing credit or relying exclusively on others to solve issues. Neither are productive uses of your intellect. Really."
