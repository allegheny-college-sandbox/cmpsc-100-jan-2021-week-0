    "GatorGrader is an Allegheny College-developed, student-written and maintained application that grades your work for you. The long and short of it, before and when you turn in your assignments, you can know what your approximate grade will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "(It doesn't do _everything_ for us, but it gives us a good starting point for evaluating your work.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to do anything to get it -- I will distribute all the files you need with every repository. You realize the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete grading transparency\n",
    "* Grading criteria _never_ changes\n",
    "* The criteria is very specific; you will know what changes you need to make\n",

    "* The whole repository\n",
