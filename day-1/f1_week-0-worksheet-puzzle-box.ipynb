    "\n",
    "For this worksheet, we're going to imagine that we have a brand new puzzle box with `3` buttons, each of which has two-states (\"pressed\" -- `True`, \"unpressed\" -- `False`). Our goal is to demonsrate how to open the puzzle box using the correct combinations of buttons. We need to combine our knowledge of these buttons (`booleans`) and what we've learned about `list`s with our new power of the `if` statement to figure out how to express the solution combination.\n",
